## HOW TO GET YOU FB cookies:
To log into Facebook, you will need your account cookies, as login via email and password is no longer supported. Follow these steps to obtain your Facebook cookies:
    *Log in to your Facebook account.
    *Install the [C3C extension](https://github.com/c3cbot/c3c-ufc-utility) in your browser.
    *Return to your Facebook account and use the extension while on the Facebook site.
    *The extension will generate your cookies, which should be saved in a JSON file.
    *These cookies will be used to interact with the Facebook server.

Make sure to store the cookies securely, as they are necessary for accessing Facebook programmatically.


## HOW TO ENCRYPT YOUR FB cookies.json:
Put your fb cookies generated by [C3C extension](https://github.com/c3cbot/c3c-ufc-utility) in the '/key/cookies.json' directory
```bash
#source venv/bin/activate required
source encrypt.sh #It will create encrypted_cookies.bin and secret_key.key
```
After encryption, make sure to store your 'secret_key'.key and 'cookies.json' in a secure location. Ensure that the path where these files are kept is not publicly accessible, especially if you're deploying on a hosting server. This will help prevent unauthorized access and keep your sensitive data safe.

## RUN THE APP:
```python
#source venv/bin/activate required
python3 app.py
```
